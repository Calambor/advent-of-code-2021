# Advent of Code in Kotlin
Another year of Kotlin to keep the mind fresh!

Part one of each day may be missing since it usually forms the base of Part 2.

# Running the code
Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA and press run on the main method of your wanted day.

# Supplying input
Create a textfile named ``credentialsCookie`` in the root of the repo and fill it with the contents of the ``Cookie`` header
that you get when using the web page.
This automatically downloads your input for your specific day and places it in a text file ``input1``..``input25`` in the root of the repo.

Optionally, create the file ``input1`` in the root of the repo and fill it yourself.
